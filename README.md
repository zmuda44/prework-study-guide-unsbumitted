# prework-study-guide
Prework study guide from Rutgers bootcamp


updating readme in the github version not on computer.

i am going to try to start over.  there are some problems that are confusing me with this stuff all with git.  the javascript, hmtl and css i pretty much got done.


i pulled the origin main and it did pull this file.  i am now writing in the computer.

however, my local folder is still called prework-study-guide.  guess that doesnt update?
